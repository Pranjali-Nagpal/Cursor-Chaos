# Cursor-Chaos🖱️💥
Warning: This project contains flashing elements and high levels of frustration. Do not attempt if you value your sanity.

## The Mission
Your goal is simple: Type the target word and click Submit.
Sounds easy? Wrong.

## The Mechanics
1. The Reverse Trap ◀️
The moment you start typing, you'll realize something is wrong. The input field forces text right-to-left. You must type the target word backwards (e.g., to type "BRAIN", you must type "N-I-A-R-B").

2. Punitive Spawning ⚠️
We don't believe in forgiveness.
The Trap: Most users fail to realize the backwards mechanic immediately, causing them to make initial typos.
The Punishment: Every time you make a typo, new fake cursors spawn.
The Spiral: The more you panic and mess up, the more cursors fill the screen, making it harder to see what you are doing.

3. Mouse Anonymity 🕵️
The decoy cursors mirror your exact mouse movements. By Level 2, you will be controlling a swarm of 500+ arrows, only one of which can actually click the button. You'll have to rely on hover-state guesswork to find your true pointer.
